# smartHomeWithRaspberry
This project was on my mind for a while now - since I live in beautiful Ireland I am in serious need of humidity and temperature sensors placed allover my apartment. I decided to go with ESP32's and Pi as MQTT server. I am aiming to build here heat and humidity map of my apartment to compare results in the future after installing mvhr (Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery) unit.
